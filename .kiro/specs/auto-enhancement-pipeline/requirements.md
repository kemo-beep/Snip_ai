6. WHEN stabilization is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the original video frame rate

### Requirement 4: Enhancement Pipeline Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have control over which automatic enhancements are applied, so that I can customize the processing to my preferences.

7. WHEN enhancement settings are displayed THEN the system SHALL show a preview of the effect before applying

### Requirement 5: Real-Time Enhancement Preview

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a preview of the enhancements before they are applied, so that I can understand what changes will be made to my video.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video is loaded in the editor THEN the system SHALL generate a preview with enhancements applied

3. WHEN the preview is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a side-by-side comparison of original and enhanced video
4. WHEN the user hovers over an enhancement toggle THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip explaining the enhancement
5. WHEN the preview is generated THEN the system SHALL use a representative frame from the middle of the video
6. WHEN the user is satisfied with the preview THEN the system SHALL provide a clear action to apply enhancements to the full video

### Requirement 6: Performance and Processing Efficiency

**User Story:** As a user, I want video enhancements to be applied quickly, so that I can export and share my content without long wait times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enhancements are applied THEN the system SHALL process videos at a rate of at least 1x real-time speed
2. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing percentage complete
3. WHEN processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL allow the user to cancel the operation
4. IF processing is cancelled THEN the system SHALL revert to the original unenhanced video
5. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL notify the user with a success message
6. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and preserve the original video
7. WHEN multiple enhancements are enabled THEN the system SHALL process them in a single optimized pipeline pass

### Requirement 7: Enhancement Quality Indicators

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand what improvements were made to my video, so that I can appreciate the value of the auto-enhancement feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enhancements are applied THEN the system SHALL display a summary of improvements made
2. WHEN the summary is displayed THEN the system SHALL show before/after metrics for each enhancement
3. WHEN color correction is applied THEN the system SHALL indicate the brightness and contrast adjustments made
4. WHEN audio enhancement is applied THEN the system SHALL indicate the noise reduction level achieved
5. WHEN stabilization is applied THEN the system SHALL indicate the amount of shake reduction applied
6. WHEN the user views the summary THEN the system SHALL provide an option to undo all enhancements
7. WHEN enhancements are minimal THEN the system SHALL inform the user that the video was already high quality
