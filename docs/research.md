Supercut.ai is a moderately complex project because it combines video recording, real-time processing, AI-powered editing, and team collaboration features. Here’s a structured breakdown of how you could approach it:

1. Core Features

To replicate Supercut.ai, your app needs these core features:

A. Video Recording

Screen capture (full screen, window, or browser tab)

Webcam capture (overlay or picture-in-picture)

Microphone recording

High-quality output (1080p or 4K)

Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, web)

Tech options:

Web: WebRTC, MediaRecorder API

Desktop: Electron + native bindings (ffmpeg, OBS SDK)

Mobile: Native iOS (AVFoundation), Android (MediaRecorder)

B. Video Storage & Streaming

Cloud storage for recorded videos (S3, GCP Storage, Azure Blob)

Generate shareable links

Handle large files efficiently

Adaptive streaming (HLS/DASH) for smooth playback

C. AI-Powered Features

This is where the app differentiates itself.

Transcription & Captions

Use OpenAI Whisper or AssemblyAI to transcribe audio.

Summaries / Highlights

Use GPT-style models to extract key points from the transcript.

Auto-Editing

Remove pauses, filler words, or noise.

Detect important segments for highlights.

Searchable Videos

Index transcripts for quick search across video content.

D. Editing Tools

Trimming and cutting videos

Adding overlays (text, call-to-action buttons)

Basic filters, noise reduction

Export in multiple formats

Tech options:

Client-side: ffmpeg.wasm (for browser)

Server-side: FFmpeg, GStreamer, OpenCV for video processing

E. Team Collaboration

Workspaces & projects

User roles & permissions

Comments, reactions

Analytics: views, engagement, watch time

Tech stack:

Backend: Node.js/Express, Django, or Go

Database: PostgreSQL (metadata), Redis (cache)

Real-time: WebSockets (comments, reactions)

F. Cross-Platform App

Desktop: Electron (JS), Tauri (Rust+JS)

Web: React/Next.js

Optional Mobile: React Native, Flutter, or native

G. Monetization & Subscription

Free + premium plans

Features gating (AI editing, HD export, team features)

Stripe/PayPal subscriptions

       |------> Real-time events (WebSocket) <----|


Backend responsibilities:

Handle user accounts & auth

Store video metadata

Trigger AI processing jobs

Manage billing & subscriptions

AI / Video pipeline:

Upload raw video

Transcode & store

Run transcription & AI processing

Generate highlights/chapters

Make ready for streaming

3. Tech Stack Example

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Electron for desktop

Backend: Node.js + Express / Go Gin

Database: PostgreSQL

Storage: AWS S3

Real-time: WebSockets / Socket.io

AI/ML: OpenAI API, Whisper, ffmpeg

Video Processing: FFmpeg, GStreamer

Authentication: Auth0 or custom JWT

Payment: Stripe or PayPal

4. Development Steps

MVP Focus

Record webcam + screen

Save & play video

Basic shareable link

Add AI

Transcription & auto-caption

Summarization / highlights

Team Features

Workspaces, comments, analytics

Polish

UI/UX improvements

Branding, export options, performance tuning

Monetization

Subscription management

Feature gating

5. Challenges

Large video file handling → requires chunking, resumable uploads

Real-time AI processing → computationally intensive

Cross-platform recording → different OS permissions

UI/UX for video editing → smooth, responsive, intuitive

Scalable storage & streaming → cost management
