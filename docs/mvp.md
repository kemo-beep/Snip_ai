MVP, only include what proves your idea works:

Screen + Webcam Recording

Single layout (PiP or side-by-side)

720p or 1080p is enough for MVP

Video Upload & Storage

Store on cloud (AWS S3, Firebase Storage, or Supabase Storage)

Generate a shareable link

Basic Playback

Simple video player embedded in your web app

AI Transcription (Optional MVP Plus)

Use Whisper / OpenAI API for captions

Display transcript alongside video

Skip team features, complex editing, auto-chapters, analytics for MVP.

2. Use Existing Tools / Libraries

Instead of building everything from scratch:

Feature	Fastest Tool / Library
Screen + Webcam Recording	RecordRTC (Web) or Electron + MediaRecorder
Video Upload & Storage	Supabase Storage (simpler than S3)
Video Player	Video.js or native <video> tag
Transcription	OpenAI Whisper API or AssemblyAI
Authentication	Supabase Auth or Firebase Auth

Using managed services avoids writing backend for storage, auth, streaming.

3. Tech Stack for Rapid MVP

Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Supabase Functions / Firebase Functions / Node.js Express (minimal API)

Storage: Supabase Storage / Firebase Storage

AI: OpenAI Whisper or AssemblyAI for transcript

Deployment: Vercel / Netlify / Supabase Hosting

No need to build a custom Electron desktop app first; browser recording is faster.

4. Step-by-Step MVP Development

Step 1: Setup Frontend

React project

Tailwind CSS for styling

Simple video recording page with RecordRTC

Upload recorded file to cloud storage

Step 2: Cloud Storage

Configure Supabase / Firebase storage bucket

On video upload, generate shareable link

Step 3: Playback

Embed the video in a simple player

Allow user to copy/share the link

Step 4: Optional AI

Send uploaded video to Whisper API

Show transcript below video

Step 5: Quick Hosting

Deploy frontend to Vercel / Netlify

Backend functions (upload, transcription trigger) on Supabase / Firebase

5. MVP Deliverables

User can record screen + webcam in browser

Upload video to cloud

View and share video via a link

Optional: view transcript/captions

Timeline:

1-2 weeks if using React + Supabase + Whisper API

No custom backend needed at this stage

No complex UI, team features, or analytics
