## Features to Consider Adding Next

1. **Multi-selection with drag box** - Already have dragSelection state, just needs implementation
2. **Clip trimming handles** - Visual handles for trimming clip in/out points
3. **Waveform visualization** - Show audio waveforms on audio clips
4. **Clip effects panel** - Add effects to clips (fade, transitions, etc.)
5. **Track groups** - Group related tracks together
6. **Nested timelines** - Support for nested sequences
7. **Keyframe animation** - Animate clip properties over time
8. **Undo/Redo stack** - Full undo/redo support
9. **Auto-save** - Periodic project auto-save
10. **Export presets** - Quick export with common presets

## Technical Notes

- Timeline uses `@xzdarcy/react-timeline-editor` library
- Snapping works at 30fps intervals (1/30 second)
- Auto-scroll follows playhead during playback
- Clips constrained to video duration (0 to duration)
- Minimum clip duration of 1 frame (~0.033 seconds at 30fps)
- Track heights are customizable per track
- Resize handles use `flexible` property from timeline library
- Locked clips have `flexible: false` to prevent resizing
- Resize callbacks: `onActionResizeStart`, `onActionResizing`, `onActionResizeEnd`

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Requires ES6+ support
- Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Smooth animations with CSS transitions

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient re-renders with React.memo and useCallback
- Optimized timeline rendering
- Debounced scroll events
- Minimal DOM updates during playback


## Clip Resizing Guide

### How to Resize Clips

1. **Hover over a clip** - Resize handles will appear on the left and right edges
2. **Click and drag** the left edge to trim the start of the clip
3. **Click and drag** the right edge to trim the end of the clip
4. **Release** to apply the resize

### Visual Feedback

- **Blue line** - Indicates the resize edge
- **White grip** - Shows the exact drag point
- **Enhanced ring** - Appears during resize (blue glow)
- **Cursor change** - Changes to `ew-resize` (↔) during resize
- **Lock icon** - Shows on locked clips (cannot be resized)

### Resize Constraints

- **Minimum duration**: 1 frame (~0.033s at 30fps)
- **Timeline boundaries**: Cannot resize before 0 or after video duration
- **Snapping**: When enabled, edges snap to frame boundaries
- **Locked clips**: Cannot be resized (track or clip lock)

### Keyboard Modifiers During Resize

- **Snapping toggle**: Click the snap button in toolbar or use the setting
- **Frame-accurate**: Snapping ensures frame-perfect edits

### Tips

- Enable snapping for precise frame-accurate edits
- Lock clips to prevent accidental resizing
- Use the time display to see exact clip duration
- Resize handles only appear on unlocked clips
- Multiple selected clips can be moved together, but resize one at a time
